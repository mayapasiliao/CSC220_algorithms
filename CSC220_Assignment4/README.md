# CSC220_Assignment4
Write code that finds a maximum flow in a directed graph, using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. 
The graph is given as adjacency matrix with cap[i][j] being the capacity of the directed edge from 
i to j. The function received another argument, the matrix flow[][], which is used to return the flow 
values in the maximum flow from s to t.
